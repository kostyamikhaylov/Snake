# Snake
console game

Simple console game for Linux
Operating:
1) Send SIGQUIT (Ctrl-4) for the snake to turn right (according to the current direction);
2) Send SIGINT (Ctrl-c) for exiting the game;

Future improvements:
1) Solve the problem with operating the snake (probably with termios functions)
2) Add some features like randomly emerging food and snake growth, walls on the game field, the possibility to cut off snake's tail when knotted;
3) In the end, turrn structures into classes and recode with C++;
